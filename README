small photo gallery written in python and django

I am using this project to learn django

and i need a photo gallery to share pictures of my kids with the familly

this project should normally be directly usable with eclipse / pydev

to remove eclipse / pydev support just remove the .project and .pydevproject files

generate and empty database with python manage.py syncdb
